In this blog on Artificial Intelligence applications, I’ll be discussing how AI has impacted various fields like marketing, finance, banking and so on.

                <p>
                Marketing is a way to sugar coat your products to attract more customers. We, humans, are pretty good at sugar coating</p><p class="optional">, but what if an algorithm or a bot is built solely for the purpose of marketing a brand or a company? It would do a pretty awesome job!<br>
                n the early 2000s, if we searched an online store to find a product without knowing it’s exact name, it would become a nightmare to find the product.

                  When it comes to saving our lives, a lot of organizations and medical care centers are relying on AI.</p> <p class="optional">There are many examples of how AI in healthcare has helped patients all over the world.

                  Over the past few years, Artificial Intelligence has become an integral part of the gaming industry.<br></p><p class="optional">
                  Shortly after the victory, DeepMind created an advanced version of AlphaGo called AlphaGo Zero which defeated the predecessor in an AI-AI face off. Unlike the original AlphaGo, which DeepMind trained over time by using a large amount of data and supervision, the advanced system, AlphaGo Zero taught itself to master the game.
